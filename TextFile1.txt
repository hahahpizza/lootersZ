 
1.  When you tap the land area, Make sure you do not land into the boxes. 
	you should land next to it so that they do not collide into each other. 
	Same goes if there are more than 1 character on the same area.

2.  When we are doing the 1st jump. 
	Do not make the AI steal anything. 
	It looks weird. 
	Same goes to  Jumping in the area where there is no coin on the enemy platform.

3.  When the player jumps on the centre platform, Make them wait for 3 seconds. 
	The one jumping on the highest loot will play hapy animation in loop.
	Multiple characters will play fight animations in loop. After that they will fall into the water ( ragdoll ).
	After 3 seconds, make the player carry the loot on top of head ( making new animations ) and jump back to the their platforms.

4.  Once the players are back to their zones, Spawn new characters in place of dead ones. 
	Spawn new loot ( shuffle ).

5.  We need 1st level to be just with 1 AI and 1 player.

	Level 02 will be 1 player and 2 AI.

	And level 3 and all after it, 3 AI and 1 player.

6.  Make a variable that will count the Total money that the character has put in the safe zone. 
	You will win / lose based on the Total money you have saved in the safe zone. 
	I will add a visual element later which will display the total money you have saved.
